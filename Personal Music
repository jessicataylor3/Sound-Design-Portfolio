The link to my full discography of music I wrote, sang, recorded, produced, mixed, and mastered.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in creating unique and cohesive soundscapes, as well as recording and manipulating high-quality audio.
My primary Digital Audio Workstation for these projects was Logic Pro X.
I released these projects onto streaming services, and so far have accrued over 100,000 streams.
