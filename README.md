# Sound-Design-Portfolio
Portfolio consisting of projects I've contributed to in terms of sound, audio, and music.

Clean Corps: This first-person shooter won third place (of 50 submissions) in the George Mason Progress @ Play 2023 Competition.
The programming, design, and production was done by game design student Alex James. I created the beachy music for Level 1, as well as some of the SFX.

The Apocalypse Approaches: This turn-based RPG was created by members of the NC State Game Design club for the 2023 Dot Game Jam. I created the battle music that loops throughout gameplay using Logic Pro X.

VGM Examples: This is a YouTube playlist consisting of different video game music I've composed and produced. Some have been used in games, and some were made during my internship with professional VGM composer Tyler Mire.

Personal Music: This is a YouTube playlist consisting of songs I wrote, recorded, and produced. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in creating unique and cohesive soundscapes, as well as recording and manipulating high-quality audio.

Communications Portfolio: This is a YouTube playlist that includes videos I helped create for the Honors College Communications Team at George Mason University. I was involved in recording and editing the audio and video, as well as creating the backing tracks.
