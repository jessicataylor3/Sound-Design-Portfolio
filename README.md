# Sound-Design-Portfolio
Portfolio consisting of projects I've contributed to in terms of sound, audio, and music.

Clean Corps: This first-person shooter won third place (of 50 submissions) in the George Mason Progress @ Play 2023 Competition.
Programming, design, and production by Alex James. I created the music for Level 1, as well as some of the SFX.

VGM Examples: YouTube playlist consisting of different video game music I've composed and produced. Some have been used in games, and some were made during my internship with professional VGM composer Tyler Mire.
