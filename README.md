# Sound-Design-Portfolio
Portfolio consisting of projects I've contributed to in terms of sound, audio, and music.

Clean Corps: This first-person shooter won third place (of 50 submissions) in the George Mason Progress @ Play 2023 Competition.
Programming, design, and production by Alex James. I created the music for Level 1, as well as some of the SFX.
